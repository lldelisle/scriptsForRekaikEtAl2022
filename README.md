# scriptsForRekaikEtAl2022

All scripts necessary to build figures from raw data in Rekaik et al. 2022.

Most of NGS analyses were done using a local galaxy instance (Afgan et al. 2018). The workflow used are in `galaxy_workflows`, in addition, the command lines have been added to each directory in the file called `on_galaxy.sh`.

`annotations` contains the different files with coordinates of regions used to display on figures or to quantify.

Each of these directories contain command lines for the corresponding analyses: `cHi-C`, `ChIP`, `RNAseq`, `scRNAseq`. They also contains figures with quantifications in the `plots` folder.

`plots` contains a bash script with all commands to generate configuration files and output files of all figures generated by [pyGenomeTracks](https://github.com/deeptools/pyGenomeTracks).

`scripts` contains scripts which have been used in this study but could be re-used in other studies.

`figures` contains symlink for all figures used in the paper relabelled correctly.
